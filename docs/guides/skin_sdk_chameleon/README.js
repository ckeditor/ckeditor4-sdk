That's because the skin itself\ndefined where and how to use colors.</p>\n\n<p>For that purpose, the <code><a href=\"#!/api/CKEDITOR.skin-method-chameleon\" rel=\"CKEDITOR.skin-method-chameleon\" class=\"docClass\">CKEDITOR.skin.chameleon</a></code> function must be\ndefined in the <code>skin.js</code> file. Please check the\n<a href=\"#!/guide/skin_sdk_intro-section-2\">Moono skin</a> files for full details.</p>\n\n<p>Note that adopting this feature is totally optional. A skin developer may decide\nto have a fixed color and not give the possibility to change it. Of course we\ndon’t recommend this, but if that is the case, it is enough to not defined the\nchameleon function in the <code>skin.js</code> file.</p>\n","title":"\"Chameleon\" Feature","meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null});
