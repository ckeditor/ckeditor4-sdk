Ext.data.JsonP.skin_sdk_icons({"guide":"<h1 id='skin_sdk_icons-section-icons'>Icons</h1>\n\n<p>An important aspect that a skin can (optionally) customize are the icons used on\nthe CKEditor toolbar and context menu. This is not mandatory in any way, but it\nmakes it possible to precisely align the icons design with the skin lines.</p>\n\n<p>The CKEditor toolbar is filled by buttons provided by plugins. These plugins\ninclude default icons for their buttons. The skin role here is eventually\noverriding those icons, by providing a different version of them. This means\nthat, if a skin icon is available for a button, it will be used, otherwise the\ndefault plugin icon is used.</p>\n\n<p>There is a huge number of plugins available for CKEditor, provided by people and\ncompanies all around the world. It is impossible for a skin developer to provide\nicons for every single plugin, so it is up to her to decide which icons to\ninclude.</p>\n\n<p>All skin icons must be included inside the <code>icons</code> folder in the skin\nfolder. The icons file name must match the name of the icon files available in\nthe <code>icons</code> folder of the plugins.</p>\n\n<p>If you want the source version of your skin to overload icons properly, you must\ninform CKEditor about the presence of your custom icons. This is optional, but\nif not done your icons will be visible in the release version of your skin only.\nCheck the <code>skin.js</code> file in the\n<a href=\"#!/guide/skin_sdk_intro-section-2\">Moono skin</a> for an example.</p>\n","title":"Icons","meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null});
