This sounds obvious, but on several languages\nused around the world this is not true. They're read starting at the right to\nthe left. This is known as the \"RTL\" reading (or writing) direction.  Some of\nthese languages are Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Uyghur.</p>\n\n<p>On software, RTL is an important aspect and it is well supported by Operating\nSystem and their applications. CKEditor is not an exception and offers\nexceptional support for RTL user interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Not that, for an application, RTL means that everything that we're used to see\nat one side of the screen, goes to the opposite side. If the close button is at\ntop-right, it is move to top-left on RTL. A toolbar starts on the left, it'll\nthen start on the right. It is like seeing the application in a mirror.</p>\n\n<p>Skin developers must take this in consideration and make the necessary CSS\nstyling to support RTL interfaces. This can be easily done by using the\n<code>.cke_rtl</code> class name, which is set at the outer element of the\neditor UI. Usage examples can be find in the\n<a href=\"#!/guide/skin_sdk_intro-section-2\">Moono skin</a> files.</p>\n","title":"Right-to-Left","meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null});
