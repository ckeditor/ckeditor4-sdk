There are serious <a href=\"#!/guide/dev_source-section-2\">performance implications</a> of doing this.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Instead, you must create a CKEditor \"build\" or \"release version\" (in contrast to the \"source version\"). It is an optimized, production-ready CKEditor distribution.</p>\n\n<h2 id='dev_build-section-the-dev%2Fbuilder-folder'>The dev/builder Folder</h2>\n\n<p>The source code of CKEditor contains a pre-configured environment that allows you to easily create editor builds.</p>\n\n<p>The following are the most relevant files that you can find there:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>build.sh</code> &ndash; the build runner Bash script.</li>\n<li><code>build-config.js</code> &ndash; the build configuration file.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 id='dev_build-section-step-1%3A-build-setup'>Step 1: Build Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Edit the <code>build-config.js</code> file, which contains the build configuration. It includes the following sections:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var CKBUILDER_CONFIG = {    \n    // Skin name.\n    skin: '...',\n\n    // Files to be ignored.\n    ignore: [ ... ],\n\n    // Plugins to be included.\n    plugins: { ... }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The most important parts are the <code>skin</code> name and the list of <code>plugins</code>. These need to be set properly and include all the things you want to have in your build.</p>\n\n<p>Some plugins might need others to work, but you do not have to resolve these dependencies by yourself as CKBuilder will do this for you.</p>\n\n<h2 id='dev_build-section-step-2%3A-running-the-builder'>Step 2: Running the Builder</h2>\n\n<p>Go to the command line and call the build script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sh build.sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The builder will be executed and the resulting build will be created in the <code>dev/builder/build</code> folder.</p>\n\n<h2 id='dev_build-section-about-ckbuilder-%28command-line%29'>About CKBuilder (Command Line)</h2>\n\n<p>The building process is handled by the command line version of <a href=\"http://ckeditor.com/builder\">CKBuilder</a>. It is a powerful application that makes several enhancement to the source code: it loads the configuration file, resolves plugin dependencies, merges and minifies files, creates icon strips, and performs many other build-related tasks.</p>\n\n<p>For the first run, <code>build.sh</code> will need to <a href=\"http://download.cksource.com/CKBuilder/\">download CKBuilder</a> and copy it into the <code>dev/builder/ckbuilder/&lt;ckbuilder version&gt;</code> folder, so an Internet connection is required. Once the file is available, no more downloads are necessary (though if possible, the script will try to perform an update on consecutive runs).</p>\n\n<p>The only requirement to run CKBuilder is <a href=\"http://www.java.com/en/download/\">Java</a>.</p>\n","title":"Building from Source","meta_description":"How to build CKEditor from source code.","meta_keywords":"ckeditor, editor, source, code, build, building, ckbuilder"});
