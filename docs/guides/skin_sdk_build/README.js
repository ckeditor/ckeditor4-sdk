Now that your skin\nis perfect as you wanted, it is time to prepare it to be used in production\nwebsites.</p>\n\n<p>To do so you'll need CKBuilder a Java application that makes this magic happen.\nIt can be downloaded here:<br>\nhttp://download.cksource.com/CKBuilder/</p>\n\n<p>[http://java.com/en/download/ Java] must be available on your command line. To\nrun the builder, simply copy <code>ckbuilder.jar</code> into the\n<code>skins</code> folder of CKEditor (where your skin custom folder is\navailable) and execute this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &gt; java -jar ckbuilder.jar --build-skin myskin myskin-release\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>myskin</code> and <code>myskin-release</code> parts are your skin\nfolder name and the destination folder name. Just use the names you prefer.</p>\n\n<p>This is the job done by CKBuilder on your skin:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Merges all CSS files parts. This means that all CSS files having\n<code>@import</code> entries will have their imported files in-lined,\nhaving just one file available.</li>\n<li>Minifies CSS and JavaScript files, reducing their size to optimize the\ndownload speed.</li>\n<li>Generates a single \"strip image\" containing all icons provided by the\nskin.</li>\n<li>Removes all unnecessary files.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>You skin is ready. The release version is the one to use on your websites or to\ndistribute to others, while the source version can be shared to the world\nthrough services like <a href=\"http://github.com/\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n","title":"Build and Release","meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null});
