Ext.data.JsonP.skin_sdk_hc({"guide":"<h1 id='skin_sdk_hc-section-high-contrast-compatibility'>High Contrast Compatibility</h1>\n\n<p>The MS Windows operating systems offers an accessibility feature called \"High\nContrast\", which turns the entire system UI into a two colors environment. This\ncan be controlled by the user, but usual we have \"black on white\" or \"white on\nblack\". This feature is used by people with sight disabilities that makes it\nhard to identify contrast differences on object colors.</p>\n\n<p>In High Contrast, all colors go away. Most of the applications UIs because just\nlines and boxes holding text labels or black and white icons.</p>\n\n<p>To quickly enable High Contrast easily on Windows, just use\n<kbd>SHIFT+ALT+PRINT_SCREEN</kbd>. Do that now! Additional settings can be\ncontrolled in the Windows Control Panel.</p>\n\n<p>CKEditor offers great support for High Contrast, limited to Firefox and Internet\nExplorer (other browsers don't support High Contrast).  When enabled, the editor\nis rendered as clear lines and the toolbar buttons present text labels, instead\nof icon images.</p>\n\n<p>Skin developers must take this in consideration and make the necessary CSS\nstyling to support High Contrast. This can be easily done by using the\n<code>.cke_hc</code> class name, which is set at the outer element of the editor\nUI. Usage examples can be find in the\n<a href=\"#!/guide/skin_sdk_intro-section-2\">Moono skin</a> files.</p>\n","title":"High Contrast","meta_description":null,"meta_keywords":null});
